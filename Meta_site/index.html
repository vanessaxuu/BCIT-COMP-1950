    <!-- A description and rationale for all site improvements.

    This is among the most important sections of the project meta site.

    This is your chance to 'sell' your efforts to your client instructor.

    This is where you describe why you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed.

    List all the deliverables you have implemented, and and any features or improvements you have added.

    Justify your decisions for choosing a particular layout and design.

    If your HTML5 improves the page semantics and thus SEO, be sure to mention it.

    If you used jQuery or CSS3, explain where it is being used, and why.

    Also List any features you had planned to implement but could not complete.

    If your rationale does not describe a sufficient quantity of improvements, and if it
    does not effectively make a case for how these changes improve the site, your client will not be
    convinced that your team is the best choice. -->
