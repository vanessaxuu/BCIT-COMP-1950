              <h2 class="content-title">Social Media Links</h2>
              <p>We added social media and YouTube channel links so that students can check the latest update from school. These links are also beneficial for BCIT 
                staffs as those external social media are easy to update.</p>

              <h2 class="content-title">SEO Contents added</h2>
              <p>Better SEO solution easy to search by keywords</p>

              <h2 class="content-title">Responsive Layout</h2>
              <p>Redesigned website is mobile friendly and become easy to check on mobile devices. Students can now read the course page
               using their smart phones while commuting.</p>

              <h2 class="content-title">- Put all lectures on the top page</h2>
              <p>You can check all the lectures without hovering the navigation. Eye catch image make it easy to see what lecture it is about.</p>

              <h2 class="content-title">Revised Color Choices</h2>
              <p>We have reduced color variation and contrast so that readers can concentrate on the content without distraction. Since BCIT's logo
                  color is navy, we have choosed similar color for the other parts of the website.
  </p>

              <h2 class="content-title">PHP inplementation</h2>
              <p> Devided components using PHP, easier to maintenance.</p>



            <!-- A description and rationale for all site improvements.
            This is among the most important sections of the project meta site.
            This is your chance to 'sell' your efforts to your client instructor.
            This is where you describe why you chose to build the site in the way you have proposed.
            List all the deliverables you have implemented, and and any features or improvements you have added.
            Justify your decisions for choosing a particular layout and design.
            If your HTML5 improves the page semantics and thus SEO, be sure to mention it.
            If you used jQuery or CSS3, explain where it is being used, and why.
            Also List any features you had planned to implement but could not complete.
            If your rationale does not describe a sufficient quantity of improvements, and if it
            does not effectively make a case for how these changes improve the site, your client will not be
            convinced that your team is the best choice. -->
